This repository contains a project called is Warehouse info.

The Project is built using React js(React router), HTML, CSS(Front end focused).

The Main objective of the project is to display the warehouse list and develop a filteration logic along with editing, updating, deleting and creating a new warehouse list.

The warehouse.json file was hosted on localhost port 5002 through json server from which GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations were performed.

I attempted to utilize redux toolkit for state management but not having prior knowledge on redux made it a huge obstacle to do the project with redux. Hence, I used good old method of hooks to maintain states.
